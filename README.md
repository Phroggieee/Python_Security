# Python_Security
A python security system project to go towards a portfolio

use the Host text file to assign the names used to determine what first and last name will need to be used to be seen as a host

similarily using the HostLoginPasswords to add a specific password needed with the name to accesss host acount

then using the HostPasswords text file to add the specific host code needed after sign in

apart from them the NameFolder and PasswordFolder will be written to and read from to check for host, so they dont need editing.


the function to store multiple names, passwords and hosts is in progress
